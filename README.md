# One Piece - Stats
I was watching One Piece and out of nowhere I started watching an episode that looked like a filler, but the platform I was watching didn't say whether it was, then after that every time I had to look on weird websites to see if the episode was filler, so I decided to find data to create an application to provide such information.   
Basically the roadmap was

```mermaid

graph TD;
    A[Find some websites with data about One Piece] --> B[Web scraping that data];
    B --> C[Descriptive analysis];
    B --> D[Web Application];
    
   
    style A fill:#1558A0,stroke:#E6EBF1,stroke-width:2px
    style B fill:#EB2A2A,stroke:#E6EBF1,stroke-width:2px
    style C fill:#1558A0,stroke:#E6EBF1,stroke-width:2px
    style D fill:#1558A0,stroke:#E6EBF1,stroke-width:2px
```
The beta of web application can be consulted [here](https://alissonrp.shinyapps.io/op_beta/?_ga=2.199898414.1077219620.1646952561-1144556888.1646851457) and the descriptive analysis [here](https://alissonrp.github.io/OP_Stats/) (at this moment in portuguese).
